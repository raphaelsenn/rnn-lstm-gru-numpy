# rnn-lstm-gru-numpy
RNNs, LSTM and GRUs from scratch in numpy - backpropagation through time by hand.

## Basic Recurrent Neural Networks

**nn_np** includes:

* `rnn_np.py`
* `gru_np.py`
* `lstm_np.py`

Each file implements recurrent neural networks using only numpy.

In `rnn_np.py`, two 1-layer elmann RNNs are provided:

* `RNN_1FC_ALL`: output layer connected to all time steps

* `RNN_1FC` output layer connected to a single time step
